# Project Management
 - **TODO.md**: Contains a list of features that we are considering adding
   - The "Next Up" section includes the items that we are going to work on next
   - **Completed tasks**: Remove finished tasks from TODO.md entirely. The sync system will automatically close the corresponding GitHub issue.
   - **New tasks**: Add new tasks without GitHub issue numbers. Use format: `- **Task title** – Task description` or `- [P2] **Task title** – Task description` for priority tasks. The sync system will automatically create GitHub issues and add issue numbers.
   - **Never manually add issue numbers** like `[#123]` to new tasks. Let the sync system handle GitHub integration.
 - **CHANGELOG.md**: Documents all notable changes to the project
 - **check.sh**: Script to run tests, formatting, and linting checks

## Task Workflow
1. Create a new feature branch with appropriate naming: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
2. Review all code and come up with a step-by-step implementation and testing plan
3. Put that plan into the TODO file, under the relevant section in Next Up
4. Confirm with the user that the plan looks good
5. If approved, begin implementation, checking off individual steps in TODO.md as they're completed
6. Make small, focused commits with conventional commit messages following the format in the Git Best Practices section
7. Run tests often and fix errors as they arise
8. When the task is complete, run check.sh to ensure no errors or linting problems
9. Run integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
10. Remove completed tasks from TODO.md and update CHANGELOG.md with the changes
11. Update documentation to reflect your changes before marking the task complete
12. Keep `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` in sync; update all
    three when modifying contributor guidelines

# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability**: Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit**: Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python**: Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability.
- **Library Selection**: Use modern libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Reusable Components**: Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Package Structure**: Organize code into logical packages and modules.
- **Balanced Modularity**: Favor modularity for maintainability, but avoid over-modularization that creates unnecessary abstraction.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations**: All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings**: All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Robust Exception Handling**: Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging**: Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors.
- **Security Awareness**: Always consider security implications, especially when handling user inputs and external data.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration**: Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Data Pipeline Management**: Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning**: Utilize `git-lfs` or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
- **Experiment Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering**: Use the prompt registry (`src/rag/prompts/`) for managing prompt templates with version control.
- **Context Handling**: Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.

## 5. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests using `pytest` for individual components.
- **Write Tests for Changes**: Add tests for all code changes whenever feasible, especially when fixing bugs or regressions.
- **Integration Tests**: Include a small number of integration tests focused on common end-user use cases.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage of business logic, but don't test third-party code.
- **Test Speed**: Keep tests focused and fast; individual unit tests should take less than 0.5 seconds.
- **Test Independence**: Avoid tests that call remote APIs or have external dependencies.
- **Test Value**: Only write tests that cover meaningful business logic; avoid tests that just exercise mocks or simple getters/setters.

# Development Workflow

- **Environment**: Use uv for package management and virtual environment.
 - **Installation**: Run `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` to install the package in development mode.
- **Running**: Activate the virtual environment before running any code.
- **CLI**: The RAG CLI can be run directly when the virtual environment is active.
- **Dependencies**: Add new dependencies to pyproject.toml, not manually with pip.
- **Formatting & Linting**: Use ruff for both formatting and linting.
- **Checks**: Run `./check.sh` before committing changes to ensure code quality.
- **Python Version**: Target Python 3.10+ for all new features.
- **Version Control**: Keep .coverage and other generated files out of git.

# Code Review and Maintenance

- **Holistic Fixes**: When fixing an issue identified by a linter, look for other instances of the same problem.
- **Focused Changes**: When implementing new functionality, keep changes focused on that particular feature.
- **Rule Compliance**: Follow established ruff rules for both formatting and linting; changes should pass these checks.
- **Self-Contained Examples**: Provide examples that can be executed without extensive modification.
- **Clear Explanations**: When explaining code or suggesting improvements, provide clear reasoning and highlight trade-offs.
- **File References**: When examples span multiple files, clearly indicate file names.
- **Best Practices**: Apply relevant best practices specific to the task (RAG, LLM app development, etc.).
- **Clarifying Questions**: If requirements are unclear, ask specific questions before proceeding.

# Code Requirements

- **Type Annotations**: All functions must include type annotations.
- **Pydantic Models**: Use Pydantic models for all API request and response schemas.
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public APIs.
- **Comments**: Annotate key logic with comments.
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples in docstrings or tests.
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling.
- **Formatting**: Follow ruff formatting rules.

# Git Best Practices

## 1. Commit Messages

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **Structured Format**: Use the following format for commit messages:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>

  <body>

  <footer>
  ```
- **Types**: Use one of these types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore.
- **Scope**: Optional field indicating the section of the codebase (e.g., cli, storage, retrieval).
- **Subject**: Concise description of the change (50 chars max, no period at end).
- **Body**: Optional detailed explanation of the change (wrap at 72 chars).
- **Footer**: Optional, reference issues and PRs (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- **Clarity**: Write in the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- **Completeness**: Explain what and why, not how (code shows how).

## 2. Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: Always keep the main branch in a deployable state.
- **Feature Branches**: Create branches for new features, fixes, or experiments.
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with prefixes:
  - `feature/descriptive-name` for new features
  - `fix/issue-description` for bug fixes
  - `refactor/component-name` for code refactoring
  - `docs/topic-name` for documentation changes
  - `test/component-name` for test additions or improvements
- **Short-lived Branches**: Keep feature branches short-lived to minimize merge conflicts.
- **Regular Rebasing**: Rebase feature branches on main regularly to stay up to date.

## 3. General Version Control

- **Gitignore**: Keep the repository clean by using appropriate .gitignore patterns.
- **Large Files**: Use Git LFS for large files, especially model weights.
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- **Generated Files**: Don't commit generated files that can be recreated.
- **History Preservation**: Avoid force pushing to shared branches.
- **Meaningful History**: Use rebase and interactive rebase to maintain a clean, meaningful history.
- **Tags**: Use semantic versioning for release tags (vX.Y.Z).
