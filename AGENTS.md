# Instructions for AI Contributors

This repository welcomes contributions from AI-based tools. When acting as an agent, follow these rules:

1. **Read `.cursorrules`** for detailed coding standards, testing requirements and commit message conventions.
2. **Run `./check.sh`** after making changes. This script formats the code, lints it and runs the unit tests.
3. **Keep commits atomic** and use the conventional commit style described in `.cursorrules`.
4. **Do not introduce external dependencies** without updating `pyproject.toml`.
5. **Never commit secrets or generated files.**

For human contributors, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
