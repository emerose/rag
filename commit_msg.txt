fix(chains): remove undefined hybrid variable references

Fixed NameError in build_rag_chain function by removing references to
undefined 'hybrid' variable. Simplified retrieval logic to use only
similarity search, removing the incomplete hybrid functionality.

- Removed duplicate function definition causing indentation error
- Removed bm25_retriever initialization with undefined hybrid variable
- Simplified _retrieve function to use only similarity search
- All tests now pass (149 passed, 2 skipped)

Fixes test failures in test_build_rag_chain, test_chain_execution,
and test_system_prompt_invoke.
