# Sample Document with Headings

This is a sample document for testing metadata extraction and chunking.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

This is the introduction section of the document. It contains some basic information about the project.

### 1.1 Background

Here we provide some background information about the RAG system.

### 1.2 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- Implement a robust RAG system
- Support metadata-aware chunking
- Enable filtering based on document structure

## Chapter 2: Implementation

This section covers the implementation details of the RAG system.

### 2.1 Architecture

The system architecture consists of several components:
1. Document processing
2. Embedding generation
3. Vector storage
4. Query processing

### 2.2 Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:
- Python for the core implementation
- LangChain for RAG components
- FAISS for vector storage
- OpenAI for embeddings and LLM

## Chapter 3: Conclusion

This concludes our sample document for testing metadata extraction and chunking.
