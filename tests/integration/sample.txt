RAG System Test Document

This is a sample document for testing the RAG system. It contains some facts that we can query:

1. The capital of France is Paris.
2. The capital of Japan is Tokyo.
3. The capital of Egypt is Cairo.
4. The capital of Brazil is Bras√≠lia.
5. The capital of Australia is Canberra.

The RAG system should be able to retrieve this information when queried properly.
For example, if we ask "What is the capital of Japan?", it should return "Tokyo".

This document will be used in integration testing to verify that the RAG system
works end-to-end from indexing to querying.
