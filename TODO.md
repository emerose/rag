## 🚀 Next

### MCP Rewrite
We are going to fully rewrite the MCP code using a new library.  Please do the following:

- write a new MCP server integration using FastMCP rather than the previous library ("mcp")
- ensure feature parity between the CLI and the MCP interfaces
- make sure the MCP server supports both HTTP and stdio interfaces
- write a comprehensive test suite for the MCP code, using the FastMCP client to connect to both the HTTP and stdio interfaces, and exercising all of the APIs
