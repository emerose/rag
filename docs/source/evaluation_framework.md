# Evaluation Framework Design

This document sketches a design for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
The goal is to measure each stage of the system so we can compare implementations and detect
regressions over time.

## Objectives
- Measure performance of document loading, text splitting, indexing, retrieval and answer generation.
- Track metrics such as latency, token counts, recall/precision and generated answer quality.
- Provide a reproducible benchmark harness using open source tools.

## Key Components
1. **Dataset management**
   - Use a small collection of documents and question/answer pairs (e.g. samples from the [BEIR](https://github.com/beir-datasets/beir) dataset).
   - Store datasets under `tests/data/` so evaluations run offline.
   - Pydantic models define dataset schema and evaluation configuration.

2. **Document loading metrics**
   - Record file type, size and parsing time with [`unstructured`](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) loaders.
   - Verify metadata extraction and count any parsing failures.

3. **Text splitting metrics**
   - Log average and distribution of chunk sizes using [`langchain.text_splitter`](https://python.langchain.com/) utilities.
   - Measure splitter runtime and token counts via `tiktoken`.

4. **Indexing and retrieval**
   - Use [`faiss`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for vector storage.
   - Capture indexing throughput and memory usage.
   - Evaluate retrieval quality with recall@k and MRR using ground truth pairs.

5. **Querying and answer generation**
   - Mock the OpenAI chat completion API to run deterministic tests.
   - Measure end‑to‑end latency and token usage for prompts and completions.
   - Compute answer similarity with BLEU or ROUGE using [`sacrebleu`](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu).

6. **Reporting and dashboards**
   - Store metrics in CSV/JSON files via [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
   - Generate plots with [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) or [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
   - Compare historical runs to highlight improvements or regressions.

## Automation
- Provide a `rag eval` CLI command that runs the full suite and outputs a summary table.
- Schedule evaluations in CI to track performance over time.

This framework allows rapid experimentation with different loaders, splitters or retrievers while
producing consistent metrics for each run.
