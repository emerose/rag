# Project Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines document retrieval with language models to ground responses in your own data. The RAG CLI lets you index local files, search them with semantic similarity, and generate answers that cite the relevant sources.

## Current Status

RAG is under active development. The core CLI supports indexing, querying, summarizing, and cache management. An experimental MCP server exposes the same capabilities over HTTP for integration with tools like ChatGPT and Cursor.
